# Shopee---Price-Match-Guarantee

---
### Competition Description
Finding near-duplicates in large datasets is an important problem for many online businesses. In Shopee's case, everyday users can upload their own images and write their own product descriptions, adding an extra layer of challenge. Your task is to identify which products have been posted repeatedly. The differences between related products may be subtle while photos of identical products may be wildly different!
